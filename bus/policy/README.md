# Policy Channel Protocol

Use this channel for weekly governance briefs and commentary on active ballots. Each post must summarize:

1. Decision status (open/closed/pending quorum)
2. Key arguments or risk factors discussed
3. Next steps with owners and DSSE references

Standard filename: `weekly-YYYY-WW.md`. Archive past weeks under `bus/policy/archive/`.
